<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>ANSWER_6</h1><br/><p> Common Services and Their Port Numbers Found IN this Nmap Scanning :- </p><p>Port	Service Name	Description</p><p>21 - 	FTP (File Transfer Protocol)	Used to transfer files between computers. Unencrypted; vulnerable to sniffing and brute-force attacks.</p><p>22	 - SSH (Secure Shell)	Provides secure remote login and command execution. Encrypted and commonly used for administration.</p><p>23	 - Telnet	Outdated remote access protocol; transmits data in plaintext. Should be avoided in favor of SSH.</p><p>25	 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)	Used for sending emails from clients to mail servers. Vulnerable if open to unauthenticated use (open relay).</p><p>53	 - DNS (Domain Name System)	Translates domain names to IP addresses. Also used in DNS amplification attacks if misconfigured.</p><p>80	 - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)	Unencrypted web traffic. Often targeted for XSS, directory traversal, and authentication bypass.</p><p>111	 - RPCBind	Maps RPC services to ports on UNIX/Linux systems. Can be abused for information gathering and exploits.</p><p>139	- NetBIOS-SSN	Used for Windows file/printer sharing. Can leak usernames, shares, and be used in SMB relay attacks.</p><p>443	 - HTTPS (HTTP Secure)	Encrypted web traffic using TLS. Safer than HTTP but still depends on correct SSL configuration.</p><p>445	 - Microsoft-DS (SMB)	Provides file and printer sharing in Windows. Vulnerable to EternalBlue (WannaCry) if unpatched.</p><p>5000	- UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)	Enables device discovery on networks. Known for remote code execution vulnerabilities.</p><p>512, 513, 514	- exec, login, shell (r-services)	Obsolete UNIX services for remote access. Unencrypted and insecure. Rarely used now.</p><p>1099	 - Java RMI Registry	Enables Java remote method invocation. Can be abused for remote code execution.</p><p>1524	 - Ingreslock	Backdoor port; often used in CTF or intentionally vulnerable machines. Rare in production.</p><p>2049	 - NFS (Network File System)	Used for sharing files in UNIX/Linux networks. Can be abused to mount and access sensitive data.</p><p>2121	 - CCProxy-FTP	Custom FTP service port, possibly used by proxy servers. Treat like regular FTP for risks.</p><p>3306	 - MySQL Database	Common open-source database server. Exposing it to the internet with weak passwords is dangerous.</p><p>5432	 - PostgreSQL Database	Advanced open-source database system. Should be secured and access-controlled.</p><p>5900	 - VNC (Virtual Network Computing)	Remote desktop sharing. Often weakly secured or without authentication.</p><p>6000	 - X11	Remote GUI sessions on UNIX/Linux. Dangerous if exposed; allows keystroke and screen capture.</p><p>6667	 - IRC (Internet Relay Chat)	Used for chat servers. Also used by botnets for C2 (Command and Control).</p><p>7000	 - AFS (Andrew File System)	Distributed file system. Rarely used; complex and could expose internal files.</p><p>8009	- AJP13 (Apache JServ Protocol)	Connector between web server and backend (like Tomcat). Vulnerable to Ghostcat (CVE-2020-1938).</p><p>8081 - 	Alt Web Interface / Icecap	Often used for secondary web interfaces. Check for exposed dashboards.</p><p>8180	- Unknown (often HTTP alternative)	Could be a custom web service; use curl, nikto, or browser to test.</p></div>

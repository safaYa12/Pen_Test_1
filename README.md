ðŸ“„ Project Description â€“ TASK 1 (Elevate Labs Internship) This project contains the completed work for Task 1 assigned during the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship program. The files include a series of structured HTML reports and embedded resources based on hands-on cybersecurity tasks and manual analysis.
# This repository contains all files and documentation related to **Task 1** of my Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship. The focus of this task is on **network scanning**, **packet analysis**, and **identifying security risks** using tools like **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.
**Objective:**  
Perform a full TCP SYN network scan, analyze captured packets, identify services running on discovered hosts, and assess potential security risks.
1-Installed and configured Nmap and wireshark 
2-Identified Local IP range
3-Ran TCP SYN scan
4-Recorded Active IPs and open ports during the scan.
5-Captured and Analyzed packets in Detail using Wireshark - tcpdump
6-Researched Common Services running on open ports
7-Identified Potential risks
8-Saved scanning Result using cherry tree and exported into symple html format , where we can load it in offline also.
Tools used :- Nmap , Wireshark , tcpdump , Linux Terminal
